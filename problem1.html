        The first European explorer to visit the area of present-day Memphis was Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto
        in
        1541 with his expedition into the New World. The high bluffs protecting the location from the waters of the
        Mississippi would then be contested between the Spanish, French, and the English as Memphis took shape. Modern
        Memphis was founded in 1819 by three prominent Americans: John Overton, James Winchester, and future president
        Andrew Jackson.[8]

        Memphis grew into one of the largest cities of the Antebellum South as a market for agricultural goods, natural
        resources like lumber, and the American slave trade. After the American Civil War and the end of slavery, the
        city
        experienced even faster growth into the 20th century as it became among the largest world markets for cotton[9]
        and
        lumber.

        Home to Tennessee's largest African-American population, Memphis played a prominent role in the American civil
        rights movement and was the site of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 1968 assassination. The city now hosts the
        National Civil Rights Museum—a Smithsonian affiliate institution. Since the civil rights era, Memphis has grown
        to become one of the nation's leading commercial centers in transportation and logistics.[10] The city's largest
        employer is the multinational courier corporation FedEx, which maintains its global air hub at Memphis
        International Airport, making it the second-busiest cargo airport in the world. In addition to being a global
        air cargo leader, the International Port of Memphis also hosts the 5th busiest inland water port in America with
        access to the Mississippi River,[11] allowing shipments to arrive by ship from around the world for conversion
        to train and trucking transport throughout the United States, making Memphis a multi-modal hub for trading goods
        for imports and exports in the United States despite its inland location.

        Today, Memphis is a regional center for commerce, education, media, art, and entertainment. The city has long
        had a prominent music scene,[12] with historic blues clubs on Beale Street originating the unique Memphis blues
        sound during early 20th century. The city's music has continued to be shaped by a multi-cultural mix of
        influences across the blues, country, rock n' roll, soul, and hip-hop genres. Memphis barbecue has achieved
        international prominence, and the city hosts the World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest, which attracts
        over 100,000 visitors to the city annually.

        History
        Main articles: History of Memphis, Tennessee and Timeline of Memphis, Tennessee
        Early history
        Occupying a substantial bluff rising from the Mississippi River, the site of Memphis has been a natural location
        for human settlement by varying cultures over thousands of years.[13] The area was known to be settled in the
        first millennium A.D. by people of the Mississippian Culture, who had a network of communities throughout the
        Mississippi River Valley and its tributaries. They built complexes with large earthwork ceremonial and burial
        mounds as expressions of their sophisticated culture.[14] The historic Chickasaw Indian tribe, believed to be
        their descendants, later occupied the site.[15]
    </p>
    <p>
        French explorers led by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle[16] and Spanish explorer Hernando de
        Soto[17][18] encountered the Chickasaw tribe in that area in the 16th century.
    </p>
    <p>
        J.D.L. Holmes, writing in Hudson's Four Centuries of Southern Indians (2007), notes that this site was a third
        strategic point in the late 18th century through which European powers could control United States encroachment
        and their interference with Indian matters—after Fort Nogales (present day Vicksburg) and Fort Confederación
        (present day Epes, Alabama): "...Chickasaw Bluffs, located on the Mississippi River at the present-day location
        of Memphis. Spain and the United States vied for control of this site, whito ch was a favorite of the
        Chickasaws."[19]:71
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1795 the Spanish Governor-General of Louisiana, Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet sent his Lieutenant
        Governor, Manuel Gayoso de Lemos, negotiate and secure consent from the local Chickasaw so that a Spanish
        fort could be erected on the bluff; Fort San Fernando de las Barrancas was the result.[20][19]:71 Holmes notes
        that consent was reached despite opposition from "disappointed Americans and a pro-American faction of the
        Chickasaws", when the "pro-Spanish faction signed the Chickasaw Bluffs Cession and Spain provided the Chickasaws
        with a trading post…".[19]:71
